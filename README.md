# Heart_Disease_Risk_Prediction_Model
Developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk using the Kaggle dataset by implementing classification algorithm (Logistic Regression) under supervised machine learning model, with end-to-end data analysis, visualization, and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.
