# Heart_Disease_Risk_Prediction_Model
<br>
Project: Heart Disease Risk Prediction Model
<br>
Description: Implemented Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn with GridSearchCV.
<br>
Developed a machine learning model to predict heart disease risk using the Kaggle dataset by implementing classification algorithm (Logistic Regression) under supervised machine learning model, with end-to-end data analysis, visualization, and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.
